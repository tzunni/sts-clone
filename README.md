# sts-clone
Limited text-based Slay the Spire port developed in Python.

## Features
### Whale Bonus
All choices except transforming a card are functional.
### Snecko Eye
You can select the relic that randomizes card costs.

## Abstract
I used this as a thought exercise in how to implement a complex game system much like the real one's. While incomplete, there's a lot to be learned with all the moving parts additional cards and relics would add, and all the challenge that would bring.

## To-Do
Unlikely, but if I ever develop this further,
- Enemy AI
- Clearer HUD
- Shop system
- More enemies
- Additional cards, characters, and relics
